If the dispute is not resolved as a result of these efforts, the matter will be submitted to final and binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. We agree to cooperate in selecting an arbitrator and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration proceedings will be conducted by one arbitrator in the English language, applying the substantive state and federal laws of and for California, excluding its laws pertaining to “conflict of law”. We specifically agree that that body of law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. The site of any proceedings shall be Orange County, California. The provisions of this section and any resulting award may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

Kofax may make minor revisions to the Support Commitment from time to time without notice to You. Support pricing shall be as quoted and agreed upon between the Parties for the initial term, and shall increase for renewal terms by an amount not to exceed 5% of the prior year term fee, provided that increases associated with additional software license purchases, if any, shall be incorporated into the base for the purpose of calculation of each annual increase. The initial one year support services term will begin on the first day of the month following the invoice date of the Software. For as long as Kofax makes support services for the Software generally available to all of its customers, this Agreement will automatically renew on each anniversary date thereafter for a new one year term, unless You give Kofax 60 days written notice, prior to the end of the current term, of Your intent not to renew. Kofax will invoice You for renewal fees up to 60 days prior to expiration of each term. Kofax may terminate and suspend performance of all support services if You fail to pay any past due Kofax invoice within 10 days of written notice of such failure, in the event of any other material breach by You which remains uncured 30 days after notice thereof or if any of the Software ceases to be subject of a valid Software License Agreement. Kofax will not provide support following expiration of this Agreement. In the event You desire support to be reinstated following expiration, You agree: 1) to pay a reinstatement fee   equal to the current annual support fee and any unpaid support fees from the date of expiration to the date of reinstatement; and 2) to pay for at least one additional year of support services from the date of reinstatement. All software maintenance releases, updates, patches, workarounds or other software and/or documentation furnished to You pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be Software, as that term is used herein.

    <string name="str_app_license_text7">  Subject to the limitations stated herein, Kofax warrants to You, the original end user, that, for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt a) the hardware key and the media on which Software is furnished will be free of defects in materials and workmanship, and b) such Software, as delivered, will materially conform to Kofax’s then-current documentation for such Software. Your exclusive remedy, and Kofax’s entire liability, under this warranty will be, at Kofax’s option, the replacement of the non-conforming Software, hardware key, media and/or documentation or a refund of the license fee You paid, subject to Your return of the Software. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer.

If the Software is, or in Kofax’s opinion might be, held to infringe as set forth above, Kofax may, at its option, replace or modify the Software so as to avoid infringement, or procure the right for You to continue to use the Software. If neither of such alternatives is, in Kofax’s opinion, commercially reasonable, You will return the infringing Software to Kofax, and Kofax\'s sole liability, in addition to its obligation to pay awarded damages, costs and expenses as set forth above, shall be to refund the license fees You paid to Kofax hereunder, depreciated on a 3-year, straight-line basis.</string>
